Applet by Nathaniel Tagg, Physics Department, Otterbein University

This is a small web applet that shows an incoming plane wave interacting with an assembly of off-resonance scatterers, which add with the primary wave to change the phase of the outgoing plane wave.  This is meant to demonstrate the phenomenon shown in Hecht chapters 3/4.

You are free to use this in your own projects, but please let me know and give me credit if you do so.
